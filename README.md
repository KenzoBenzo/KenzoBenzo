👋 Hey there! I'm Makenna.

- 🖥 I'm self taught and work in the product trio - design, development and management.

The likes of [Whop](https://whop.com), [ClickUp](https://clickup.com/), [GraphCMS(now Hygraph)](https://hygraph.com/), Visly (Acquired by Figma), [Commandbar](https://www.commandbar.com/), [Plain](https://www.plain.com/), [Heron](https://twitter.com/heronapp), [Meeshkan](https://meeshkan.com/).

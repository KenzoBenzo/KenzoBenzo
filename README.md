👋 Hey there! I'm Makenna.

I'm motivated by building products that lean into wicked cool moments via stunning (micro) animations, polished design, and deeply thought-through processes. I thrive in autonomous, proactive environments, and am stoked to dive deep into new tech/tools and concepts.

- I'm a well rounded engineer, having solo-built several startups, with experience in Frontend, Backend, Product, Design and even a little Marketing. I enjoy to dive deep into the intersection of design and code through _**Design Engineering**_.
- 👷🏼‍♀️ I've had the pleasure of working with several high-class teams as either a sub-10 employee, early stage contractor, or a founder. The likes of [Whop](https://whop.com), [ClickUp](https://clickup.com/), [GraphCMS(now Hygraph)](https://hygraph.com/), Visly (Acquired by Figma), [Commandbar](https://www.commandbar.com/), [Plain](https://www.plain.com/), and founding at [Halite](https://halite.app) [Heron](https://twitter.com/heronapp), [Meeshkan](https://meeshkan.com/).
- 🏳️‍🌈 I live with my wife, Špela - and cat, Einštien
